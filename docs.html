    <h2>Geting an art from API</h2>
    <p>
        To Get a random art from the API, you need to send a GET request to the following URL:<br>
        <code>https://<span class="domain"></span>/api/art</code>
    </p>
    <hr size="1">
    <h2>Uploading an art to the API</h2>
    <p>
        To upload an art to the API, you need to send a POST request to the following URL:<br>
        <code>https://<span class="domain"></span>/api</code>
        If you get a 400 Bad Request look at the response body for more information,<br><br>
        After you have uploaded an art make sure you store the ID and Pass for later.

    <h2>Deleting your art</h2>
    <p>
        To delete your art, you need to send a DELETE request to the following URL:<br>
        <code>https://<span class="domain"></span>/api/YOUR_ART_ID<span id="id"></span></code>
        Replace YOUR_ART_ID with the ID you got from the API after uploading,
        If you get a 401 Unauthorized response then make sure to send this in the request body:
        <code>{"pass": "YOUR_PASSWORD"}</code>
        Replace YOUR_PASSWORD with the Pass you picked while uploading,
        If you cant delete it then send us an email at <code>art@mail.sx9.is-a.dev</code>
